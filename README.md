# LLVM-Code-Generation-for-C--
1. Implemented an LLVM bitcode generator for C--(subset of C programming language) by interpreting the language specification, grammar and the semantics of the language.
2. Built a lexer and a parser to generate control flow in LLVM IR for : switch, if-else, while, for, break and continue statements in C--.
3. Enhanced the parser to interpret- functions, integers, pointers, variables, arithmetic, logical operations, integer types given in C-- as input.
